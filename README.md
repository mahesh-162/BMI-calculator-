## 🧠 How BMI is Calculated

> BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m) × height (m))

It then categorizes the result as follows:

| BMI Range       | Category        |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| < 18.5          | Underweight      |
| 18.5 - 24.9     | Normal weight    |
| 25 - 29.9       | Overweight       |
| ≥ 30            | Obese            |
